Program either just strips adapter off ends of reads, or does that and finds probable adjacent reads with unambigous alignments.

Uses presence of adapter to infer insert size < read length, so read overlapping is forced in that case.

If adapter is present, start at the adapter position, and calculate the best alignment within some range of that position, say 5 bases.
